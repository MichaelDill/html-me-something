                <h3>A little about me...</h3>

                <p>My first experience with computer science came quite a long time ago. I built my first Html page when I was about eleven. I remember the amazement and satisfaction I felt from creating something with nothing but specially formatted text in a file. As the internet and the technology that drove it evolved, I did not do a good job keeping up.</p>

                <p>By the time I was ready to choose a major for college, I was very far behind, and from my perspective the amount of information I needed to learn was overwhelming. With the advice of several people, who told me that it was a safe route, I ended up majoring in Accounting. Since I had a natural affinity for math, it seemed like a good idea. In the end I pretty much hated it... like truly despised it. Long story short, I changed majors and finished with a general business degree. Upon returning home I took a management role at a restaurant I used to work at. This was only supposed to be temporary arrangement, but time flew by pretty quickly, and I felt stuck. I had been looking for a job that I could utilize my degree in, but at the time it did not seem like there was anything available.</p>

                <p>Then came a turning point. My wife and I, found out that we were pregnant with twins. This set of a chain reaction in my brain. I needed to make a change in every way, and I was more motivated than ever. My restaurant job was simply not going to do anymore. I ended up getting a job as a Technical Support Analyst. That may not sound that great, but the job had amazing benefits compared to my restaraunt job in which I only had a little health insurance. This job also put my problem solving capabilities and general IT knowledge to work. This job also had the added benefit of getting me working with software every day, in an agile based software as a service company. Just being on the inside gave me insight into how development organizations operate, and re-kindled my passion for computer science.</p>

                <p>I began studying every resource I could get my hands on. The only issue was that there is so much information, that it was hard to know where to start. At the same time, I was seeing how brilliant some of the professionals out there were; especially the ones inside my company. I began to doubt my ability to become as amazing as they were.</p>

                <p>I signed up for a class with LaunchCode. For those of you who don't know, LaunchCode is an organization that provides courses at no charge, to help people get jobs in development and computer science. Although I already knew quite alot going in, this class has been am amazing help at building a solid foundation, and building the confidence needed to pursue a development job in the future.</p>
